## Projectdescription

This is an ongoing project for my portfolio, to show my backend skills in creating a PHP server connected to a MySQL-database, in a local Docker environment. For this project, I am currently building an Hp (Harry Potter) database, where future users will be able to create *CRUD* operations
on characters from the Hp-series.

Furthermore, I will add authentication, so that users can register, login and save their favourite characters in a list.
Stay tuned, as this is an ongoing project!
